## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes:

- **200:** Success
- **201:** Created successfully
- **400:** Bad request (validation errors, duplicates)
- **404:** Resource not found
- **500:** Internal server error

Error responses follow this format:
```json
{
  "detail": "Error description message"
}
```

## Authentication & Security

Currently, the API does not implement authentication. For production use, consider adding:
- JWT token authentication
- Rate limiting
- Input sanitization
- HTTPS enforcement

## CORS Configuration

The API includes CORS middleware with permissive settings:
```python
allow_origins=["*"]
allow_credentials=True
allow_methods=["*"]
allow_headers=["*"]
```

**Note:** Restrict origins in production environments.

## Startup & Initialization

The API uses an async context manager for lifecycle management:

1. **Startup:** Attempts to load data from `data.json`, falls back to empty algorithm
2. **Runtime:** Maintains global algorithm instance
3. **Shutdown:** Graceful cleanup

## Development Setup

### Running the API
```bash
# Direct execution
python main.py

# Using uvicorn
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

## Usage Examples

### Adding a Team Member
```python
import requests

member_data = {
    "id": "TM001",
    "name": "Alice Johnson",
    "email": "alice@company.com",
    "department": "Engineering",
    "skills": [
        {
            "name": "Python",
            "proficiency": 9,
            "years_experience": 5.0,
            "last_used": "2024-01-15"
        }
    ],
    "experience_level": "SENIOR",
    "availability_status": "AVAILABLE",
    "current_workload": 60.0
}

response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/members", json=member_data)
print(response.json())
```

### Finding Best Team for Project
```python
import requests

response = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/projects/PRJ001/best-team")
team = response.json()

for member in team:
    print(f"{member['member_name']}: {member['total_score']:.2f}")
```

### Updating Algorithm Weights
```python
import requests

new_weights = {
    "skill_match": 0.4,
    "availability": 0.3,
    "experience": 0.2,
    "cost": 0.1
}

response = requests.put("http://localhost:8000/algorithm/weights", json=new_weights)
print(response.json())
```

## Best Practices for Future Development

### 1. Data Consistency
- Always validate input data using Pydantic models
- Handle date formats consistently (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Maintain referential integrity between members and projects

### 2. Error Handling
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors for debugging

### 3. Performance Considerations
- Consider pagination for large datasets
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize matching algorithm for large member pools

### 4. Testing
- Write unit tests for all endpoints
- Test edge cases (empty datasets, invalid IDs)
- Performance test with realistic data volumes

### 5. Documentation
- Keep API documentation updated
- Provide clear examples for complex endpoints
- Document algorithm behavior and scoring logic

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Database Integration:** Replace in-memory storage with persistent database
2. **Authentication:** Implement secure user authentication
3. **Batch Operations:** Support bulk member/project operations
4. **Advanced Filtering:** Add more sophisticated search and filtering
5. **Notifications:** Email/webhook notifications for team assignments
6. **Analytics Dashboard:** Visual analytics and reporting features
7. **Export Features:** CSV/PDF export for reports and data
8. **Audit Logging:** Track all changes and operations
9. **Multi-tenant Support:** Support multiple organizations
10. **Real-time Updates:** WebSocket support for real-time notifications
